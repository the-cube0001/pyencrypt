# pyencrypt
Simple python encrypter/decrypter with passcode

HOW TO INSTALL:

Run the install_dependencies.bat file to install the dependencies

HOW TO USE:

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where pyencrypt.py is located.
To encrypt a file, use the following command:

`python pyencrypt.py --encrypt <file> --code <passcode>`

To decrypt a file, use the following command:

`python pyencrypt.py --decrypt <file> --code <passcode>`

Replace `<file>` with the name of the file you want to encrypt/decrypt, and `<passcode>` with the 
passcode you want to use to encrypt and decrypt the file.

If no passcode is specified using the --code argument, the script prompts the user to enter a passcode at runtime. This allows the user to securely enter the passcode without it being visible on the command line.
